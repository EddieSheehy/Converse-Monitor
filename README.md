# Converse-Monitor

This project was a paid job by a group of people who were looking to buy and sell an indemand converse shoe collab with off-white.
The script would check wether the product was matching the "keywords" and then check if the product was loaded and if so then load the sizes in stock and periodically update via discord webhook what sizes were remaining in stock.

## How to run
```bash
python3 ConverseMonitor.py
```

## Example of Discord Webhook
